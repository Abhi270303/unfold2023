# Cross Chain NFT Lending Platform

Welcome to the Cross Chain NFT Lending Platform, a revolutionary decentralized finance (DeFi) project that empowers NFT holders to leverage the value of their NFT assets across different blockchain networks. With this platform, you can borrow funds against your NFT holdings and maintain the health of your NFTs on various chains without the hassle of dealing with multiple platforms.

## Project Overview

The Cross Chain NFT Lending Platform is designed to simplify the process of using your NFTs as collateral for loans and provide you with a convenient and efficient solution for managing your NFT assets. Here's a step-by-step guide on how the platform works:

1. **Deployment and Minting:**
   - Deploy the NFT.sol contract on the Avalanche FUJI network.
   - Mint NFTs for any address on the FUJI network.

2. **LendBorrow Contract:**
   - Deploy the LendBorrow.sol contract on the Avalanche FUJI network.
   - Fund the LendBorrow.sol contract on FUJI with your NFTs.

3. **Cross-Chain Approval:**
   - Give approval to the LendBorrow.sol contract on the FUJI network so that he can pull NFT from our NFT contract.

4. **Bridging NFTs:**
   - Deploy the Bridge Contract for the FUJI network.
   - Set the bridge for the LendBorrow.sol contract to enable cross-chain messaging management.

5. **Cross-Chain Expansion:**
   - Deploy the LendBorrow.sol contract on the Polygon network.
   - Deploy the Bridge Contract for Polygon.
   - Set the bridge for the LendBorrow.sol contract on Polygon.

6. **Interconnected Lending:**
   - Set bridges between the FUJI and Polygon networks to facilitate seamless cross-chain transactions means set the addresses of bridges on both lendborrow contracts so that bridges can communicateb with each other.

7. **Asset Valuation:**
   - Set floor prices (Manually Chainlink Floor price of NFT is not avaialble for fuji) for your NFT assets on the FUJI network to ensure that your NFTs maintain their value.

8. **Deposit and Withdrawal:**
   - Deposit your NFT assets to secure a loan on any chain of your choice.
   - Borrow DUSD tokens based on your cumulative borrowing power.
   - Withdraw tokens from anywhere you have collateral.
